      description: 'The Northwest’s original, unfiltered and dry hopped amber ale. African Amber’s pioneering and innovative style is proof that drinkabilty does not have to be achieved by sacrificing flavor. This beer erupts with a floral, hoppy taste, followed by a well rounded malty middle, finishing with a nicely organic hop flavor. Locally sourced two row grain and a blend of specialty malts give our amber its rich taste. Further complexity is achieved by leaving the beer unfiltered, providing exceptional flavor, as well as giving our amber its unique "cloudy" look. Lastly, we dry hop with locally grown, Yakima valley hops creating what has become the original, cult classic, northwest amber ale.',

We use 50% locally sourced two-row pale malt and 50% locally grown northwest malted wheat well above the required 30% wheat additions to be called a wheat beer. This Northwest style Hefeweizen is unfiltered for a "cloudy" appearance and brewed with plenty of Yakima valley hops yielding a wonderful citrus finish, delicious with or without a lemon garnish.',

      description: 'Cocoa, coffee, and smoky notes of dark-roasted barley combine to form the Blackcat Porter’s aroma profile. Notes of chocolate and coffee welcome the taste buds, finishing dry with a bit of smokiness that slowly becomes more present as the beer lingers on the palate. Although dark in color, the porter has a relatively light body and very low bitterness making it a more sessionable porter that can be enjoyed year round.',

Coffee and roasted barley notes are imparted from additions of Midnight Wheat and Dark Crystal Malt. Flaked oats provide the beer a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Kent Golding\'s hops are added with restraint, allowing the well-developed malt body to shine through. Maxx Stout finishes clean, crisp and semi dry on the palate.',
